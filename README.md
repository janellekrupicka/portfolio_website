## Janelle's Portfolio Website

This is my unfinished personal website, which will contain my work experience and projects and which will eventually be deployed as a static site. I am making this web app with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) in TypeScript bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### View This Site
(Instructions by Next.js)

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Other Notes

This project uses Font Awesome for some small icons, which requires an integrity key. Save your integrity key in `.env` as `INT_KEY` to view the icons.
